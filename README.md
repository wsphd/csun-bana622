## Introduction/Background/Motivation

  * Programming supports Analytics but Analytics, fundamentally, supports Decison-making
    * Analytics or Automation?: [Seven Approaches to Decision Making (see slide #4)]<https://ocw.smithw.org/mgt360/hbr-davenport-better-decisions.pptx>

  * (Horizontal) Workflow
    * Where in the workflow are you (and your team) working?: [Disney Workflow example]<images/analytics-disney.pdf>

  * (Vertical) Stack
    * Where in the stack are you (and your team) working?: [Analytics Stack example]<images/analytics-stack.pdf>

  * How do you learn best?
    * Books, Classes, Data camps, User Groups/Meetups, Conferences, Workshops, YouTube, podcasts
    * Some contemporary tools are highly interactive: [Google Colab]<https://colab.research.google.com/>
    * Bottom line: programming is no different than any other skill--it's mostly just _practice_


## Trade-offs: Graphical User Interface (GUI) vs. Command Line Interface (CLI)

  * Tensions
    * What are the Skills, Knowledge, and Abilities of you?...your team?...non-team colleagues?...organization's decision-makers?
    * What is important? Reproducibility?...Scalability...Interoperability?

  * Transitions (Should You Learn to Code?)
    * : Pro (yes): [UK programming requirement]<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study>
    * : Con (no): [AI-assisted (GitHub Co-pilot)]<https://github.com/features/copilot>


## Trade-offs: Commerical Off-the=Shelf (COTS) vs. Free/Open Source Software (FOSS)

  * Tensions
    * MS-PowerBI (Business Intelligence), Tableau
    * R, Python, Julia, Observable

  * Transitions
    * [Open Source Adoption in the Pharmaceutical Industry]<https://www.r-bloggers.com/2025/02/open-source-adoption-in-pharma-opportunities-and-challenges/>


## Trade-offs: Relatively Platform-dependent vs. Relatively Platform-independent

  * Tensions
    * R, Python, Julia
      * Even within R there are choices- e.g., base R, tidyverse, data.table, DBI, polars
      * Even within Python there are choices- e.g., base Python, pandas, Relational DBMS, noSQL
      * Even within Julia there are choices- e.g., base Julia, DataFrames.jl, Query.jl, DataToolKit.jl

  * Transitions
    *


## Trade-offs: Text Editor (with or without some code help) v. Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

  * Tensions
    * R, Python, Julia
      * Even within R there are choices- e.g., base R, tidyverse, data.table, DBI, polars
      * Even within Python there are choices- e.g., base Python, pandas, Relational DBMS, noSQL
      * Even within Julia there are choices- e.g., base Julia, DataFrames.jl, Query.jl, DataToolKit.jl

  * Transitions
    *


## Trade-offs: Need Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or Microservices?

  * Tensions
    * Business Intelligence

  * Transitions
    *


## Trade-offs: Verbose Documentation (large and explicit) vs. Terse Documentation (small and implicit)

  * Tensions
    * Business Intelligence

  * Transitions
    *
